# first-golang

This is my first actual Go program. It is not really good, but at least it
takes input and does a little math.

@todo Fix math, the calculation is just wrong
@todo Add comments
@todo Create functions to handle data input
@todo Ensure input is of the proper type (numbers vs strings etc)
@todo Create functions to handle calculations

More to come. v0.0001
