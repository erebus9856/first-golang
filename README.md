# first-golang

This is my first actual Go program. It is not really good, but at least it
takes input and does a little math.

@todo Fix math, the calculation is just wrong (I think its better now, check more)
@todo Add comments
@todo Updated int input function to allow for ranges
@todo Create functions to handle calculations
@todo Fix this README file, does not render correctly on github :(

More to come. v0.0001
